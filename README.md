Brian's Git Hub Home Page

This is the home page for my web developer portfolio.  It has an overview of my skills and a list of the projects I have completed so far.  The nav bar at the top of each page links connects the user to various resources. The design is loosely inspired by the graphic designs seen on Star Trek.
