				<p>As a Front End Developer, I have a Certificate in Web Development and bachelors degrees in Physics and English, which gives me the versatility to speak about and explain a wide variety of topics. </p>
				<p>I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My three years of teaching physics, algebra, and video production classes complement and reinforce these skills. I created my first website in 1998 and have diligently maintained and updated it ever since then. More recently I’ve built a portfolio of my projects from web developer classes, including a starship patrol game using a Firebase Database, and MomentJS. All of this has given me a firm foundation in explaining complex, non-intuitive processes, and organizing groups of people and technical resources to create aesthetically pleasing and marketable products. </p> 
            	<p>I have a good eye for detail and am well organized, with a talent for predicting possible future problems. Skilled at explaining complex ideas and seeing things from multiple points of view. I’m a drama-free worker with whom everyone finds easy to get along and I have no problem following detailed instructions. </p>

					<p>I love stories – fantastical mind expanding stories.  Stories that poke the emotions and blow the mind are my favorite (so Speculative Fiction, in general and Science Fiction in detail).  I like to find my brain and expectations challenged and norms subverted.  I love stories with mystery and unexplained elements that are rationalized through the process of the protagonists grappling with the problem.  I enjoy a solidly structured plot but will put up with a silly one if it takes my mind somewhere interesting. </p>
					<p>The exception to the ‘mind over emotion’ story seems to be stories of sacrifice for intense friendship and family.  I’m especially drawn to stories about found and forged families (rather than biological families).  Romance is obviously one such example but it tends to be the one I’m least interested in.  My reactions to these stories is all together much more primal and emotional, and I find it much harder to explain exactly why I enjoy them. </p>
